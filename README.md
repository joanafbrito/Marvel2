## Abstract

* The Marvel2U App is a React App that gives a user the ability to search through Marvel Characters and quickly find information on them. 

- As a user, when I visit the app, I should be able to search for any Marvel Character by name.
- As a user, when I visit the app on a computer or tablet, I should be able to see a display of some fo the Marvel Characters.
- Character Details: As a user, I should be able to access a page that contains The searched Character's detail information. 
- As a user, I should be able to return to the Home Page of the app from any other page.

This project is a solo project for Turing School of Software & Design during module 3.

*Hi! My name is [Joana](https://github.com/joanafbrito)!👩🏻‍💻🌴  I am a current Front End Engineering student at Turing School of Software Design. I am a career changer! I've  spent the last decade working to manage two small business, and grabbing the opportunity to move to another country.*
*Now, I'm spending my days learning code and playing with my dog. As a woman I can contribute to build a more balanced society, where people can be seen as equals in the software industry and where I can build apps more inclusive making a difference using this huge platform of the internet!*

### Challenges


- Balancing fun/life with project/work/study time 👩🏻‍💻 💅🏻 💆🏻‍ 🐈 🎸
- Very, very short time to build the app + healthy challenges
- Use the api with limit access 
- I had the last 24 hour of the project without any access to the api and any URL or URI linked to the characters....
- Gave me the understanding of why having a complete sample data file is so important (I had only a small one/ not complete to work with)

## Future Designs/Extensions

- The user will be able to click in the series and have a detailed page with the series info and if it a tv series a embeded youtube trailer video.
- The user will be able to login/logout with username and password.
- The user will be able to save their favorite characters within their account.
